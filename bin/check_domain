# This script checks if the input is available as a domain name in one of the
# top-level domains .com, .org, .net or .se. If the domain name is not
# available, its expiration date will be printed, if the flag --expiry was
# supplied as the second argument.

# These are the relevant rows that will show up if the domain is available:
#     .com    No match for "DOMAIN.COM".
#     .org    NOT FOUND
#     .net    No match for "DOMAIN.NET".
#     .se     "domain.se" not found.

# These are the relevant rows that will show up if the domain isn't available:
#     .com    registration-expiration:         01-Jan-2013
#     .org    Expiration Date:01-Jan-2013 12:00:00 UTC
#     .net    Expiration Date: 01-jan-2013
#     .se     expires:          2013-01-01
